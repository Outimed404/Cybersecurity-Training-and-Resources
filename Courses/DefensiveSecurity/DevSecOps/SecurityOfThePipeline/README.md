# Security of the Pipeline

The "Security of the Pipeline" module is a critical component of the DevSecOps pathway, emphasizing the protection of code, configurations, and build processes within a secure CI/CD pipeline. This module explores essential principles and practices for safeguarding the journey of code through development, testing, and deployment, ensuring security and resilience against threats and unauthorized changes at every stage.

In this repository, you’ll find three key documents that guide you through the foundational elements of pipeline security:

- **[Intro to Pipeline Automation](IntroToPipelineAutomation.md)**: This document provides an overview of pipeline automation and its role in secure code delivery. Learn how automated workflows enhance security, efficiency, and reliability across development, testing, and deployment stages.

- **[Source Code Security](SourceCodeSecurity.md)**: Focuses on securing the source code itself, including best practices for version control, access management, and prevention of unauthorized modifications. This file is a guide to maintaining code integrity from the first commit to deployment.

- **[CI/CD and Build Security](CI_CD_Build.md)**: Delves into securing CI/CD processes and build environments, with strategies to mitigate risks within the continuous integration and deployment lifecycle. Topics include secure configurations, dependency management, and protection against build tampering.

Explore each document to gain a comprehensive understanding of secure pipeline practices within DevSecOps. By implementing these security measures, you’ll support a robust, automated, and secure software development process.
