# DevSecOps Learning Path

Welcome to the **DevSecOps Learning Path** repository! This repository organizes resources and hands-on labs to help you understand, secure, and implement DevSecOps practices across the software development lifecycle. Each folder here corresponds to a focused topic within DevSecOps, with practical exercises available on **TryHackMe** to solidify your knowledge.

## üìö Course topic from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/r/path/outline/devsecops)

The following folders are organized in the recommended learning order:

### 1. SecureSoftwareDevelopment  
- **Description**: Dive into the foundational principles of secure software development. Learn how to write, test, and maintain secure code by following best practices and incorporating security from the earliest stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Topics include threat modeling, secure coding principles, and application security basics.
- **TryHackMe Module**: Secure Software Development

### 2. SecurityOfThePipeline  
- **Description**: In this section, explore the importance of securing the entire CI/CD pipeline. Learn how to assess and mitigate security risks associated with build, testing, and deployment phases. This section covers tools, configurations, and best practices to ensure that your pipeline is resilient against attacks.
- **TryHackMe Module**: Security of the Pipeline

### 3. SecurityInThePipeline  
- **Description**: Building on the previous topic, Security in the Pipeline focuses on incorporating security testing and automated checks directly into the CI/CD process. Understand how to set up automated scans, vulnerability assessments, and runtime security checks to catch issues before they reach production.
- **TryHackMe Module**: Security in the Pipeline

### 4. ContainerSecurity  
- **Description**: As containers play a significant role in modern DevSecOps environments, this section provides a detailed look at container security practices. Learn how to secure container images, handle vulnerabilities, and manage secure configurations to protect containerized applications and services.
- **TryHackMe Module**: Container Security

### 5. InfrastructureAsCode  
- **Description**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows teams to define and manage infrastructure through code. This section covers best practices for writing, securing, and validating IaC scripts to ensure that infrastructure deployments are consistent, scalable, and secure.
- **TryHackMe Module**: Infrastructure as Code

## üí° Additional Learning Resources

This repository also includes folders for topics relevant to DevSecOps:

- **DefensiveSecurity**: Provides techniques and methodologies for defending applications, systems, and networks. Perfect for those looking to understand and implement defense mechanisms throughout the SDLC.
- **WebApplicationSecurity**: Focuses on security practices specific to web applications, with insights into vulnerabilities like the OWASP Top Ten, authentication, authorization, and secure data handling.
- **PenetrationTestingBasics**: Learn the essentials of penetration testing and how to apply them to identify and fix vulnerabilities within your applications and infrastructure.
- **NetworkSecurityFundamentals**: Gain a foundational understanding of network security principles that complement application and infrastructure security efforts.
- **AdvancedExploitation**: Explores advanced exploitation techniques, ideal for understanding how attackers think, which helps in building more secure applications and systems.
