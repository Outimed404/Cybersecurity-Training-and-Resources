# Task 4 : IaC - The Tools Part 2 
## Immutable vs. Mutable Infrastructure

Infrastructure can be categorized as **immutable** or **mutable**, depending on whether changes can be applied directly or require a complete rebuild. Here's a breakdown of both approaches:

---

## **Mutable Infrastructure**
- **Definition**: Infrastructure is modified in place without the need for a complete rebuild.
- **Advantages**:  
  - Efficient use of resources since changes are applied directly.  
  - Faster updates for tasks like regular maintenance.  
- **Disadvantages**:  
  - Risk of inconsistent states if an update fails partially (e.g., some servers may not fully update).  
  - Debugging issues can be complex, especially when different versions coexist.
- **Example Use Case**: Updating a critical database system where rebuilding from scratch introduces risks.  
- **Tools**: Chef, Puppet, Ansible (supports both mutable and immutable configurations).

---

## **Immutable Infrastructure**
- **Definition**: Infrastructure cannot be modified once provisioned. Changes require creating a new instance, applying updates, and replacing the old infrastructure.  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Ensures consistency across environments (e.g., version 2 is deployed without partial updates).  
  - Easier debugging since the previous version remains intact until the new one is fully functional.  
  - Failure recovery is simpler â€” the failed infrastructure can be torn down and recreated.  
- **Disadvantages**:  
  - Resource-intensive due to the need for parallel infrastructures during updates.  
  - Slower deployment for updates.  
- **Example Use Case**: Deploying a web application update to ensure consistency across all servers.  
- **Tools**: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Pulumi.

---

## **Provisioning vs. Configuration Management**

IaC tools can also be categorized based on their **purpose**:

## **Provisioning Tools**
- **Definition**: Tools that set up infrastructure, defining and creating resources (e.g., servers, databases, and networks).  
- **Examples**:  
  - Terraform  
  - AWS CloudFormation  
  - Google Cloud Deployment Manager  
  - Pulumi  

## **Configuration Management Tools**
- **Definition**: Tools that manage the software and settings within provisioned infrastructure, such as installing, configuring, or updating software.  
- **Examples**:  
  - Ansible  
  - Chef  
  - Puppet  
  - SaltStack  

### **Example Workflow**
A company deploying a new web application could:  
1. Use **Terraform** to provision the servers, databases, and networks.  
2. Use **Ansible** to install and configure the necessary application software and monitoring agents.

---

## **IaC Tools Summary**

| Tool                 | Paradigm          | Agent Type  | Infrastructure Type | Primary Use         |
|----------------------|-------------------|-------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Terraform**        | Declarative       | Agentless   | Immutable           | Provisioning        |
| **Ansible**          | Hybrid            | Agentless   | Mutable/Immutable   | Configuration Mgmt. |
| **Pulumi**           | Declarative       | Agentless   | Immutable           | Provisioning        |
| **AWS CloudFormation** | Declarative     | Agentless   | Immutable           | Provisioning        |
| **Chef**             | Imperative        | Agent-based | Mutable             | Configuration Mgmt. |
| **Puppet**           | Declarative       | Agent-based | Mutable             | Configuration Mgmt. |

# Task 7 : On-Prem IaC vs. Cloud-Based IaC

## **On-Premises vs. Cloud-Based Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has two primary use cases: **on-premises** and **cloud-based**. The choice between these depends on factors such as control, scalability, cost, and the specific needs of the organization. This guide outlines key differences across five categories and highlights the unique benefits of each approach.

---

## **Key Differences**

### **1. Location**
- **On-Premises**:  
  - Infrastructure resides physically within an organizationâ€™s premises or in rented data centers.
  - Managed and maintained directly by the organization.
- **Cloud-Based**:  
  - Utilizes infrastructure hosted in the cloud by providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, or GCP.
  - Resources are virtual and provisioned on demand.

---

### **2. Technology**
- **On-Premises**:  
  - Common tools: **Ansible**, **Chef**, **Puppet**.
  - These tools manage physical servers, network devices, and storage systems.
- **Cloud-Based**:  
  - Common tools: **Terraform**, **AWS CloudFormation**, **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**, **Google Cloud Deployment Manager**.
  - Designed to exploit the elasticity of cloud computing and leverage CSP-specific features.

---

### **3. Resources**
- **On-Premises**:  
  - Deals with physical hardware and related challenges:
    - Hardware compatibility.
    - Physical maintenance and upgrades.
  - Often preferred by organizations with legacy systems or specific regulatory requirements.
- **Cloud-Based**:  
  - Interacts with virtual resources managed by the CSP:
    - Virtual machines, databases, storage, and networks.
  - The underlying infrastructure is abstracted and maintained by the CSP, freeing up user resources.

---

### **4. Scalability**
- **On-Premises**:  
  - Scaling is slow and requires manual intervention:
    - Procurement and physical installation of new hardware.
    - Planning for peak loads in advance.
  - Example: Universities preparing for traffic spikes during exam seasons.
- **Cloud-Based**:  
  - Leverages the elastic nature of the cloud:
    - Auto-scaling policies dynamically adjust resources based on demand.
    - Ideal for applications with fluctuating resource needs, such as online games during events.
  - Example: Retailers scaling up for Black Friday traffic and scaling down afterward.

---

### **5. Cost**
- **On-Premises**:  
  - High initial investment for physical hardware and ongoing maintenance costs.
  - Cost is fixed regardless of usage.
  - Often chosen for reasons other than cost, such as control or compliance.
- **Cloud-Based**:  
  - Pay-as-you-go pricing:
    - Only pay for resources used.
    - Enhanced efficiency with auto-scaling to avoid overprovisioning.
  - Example: Streaming services scaling resources during a popular release and scaling back later.

---

## **Benefits**

### **On-Premises IaC**
1. **Complete Control**:  
   - Full authority over the infrastructure, hardware, and data management.
   - Necessary for compliance with strict security and regulatory requirements (e.g., data sovereignty).  
   - Example: Large financial institutions or government agencies managing sensitive data.
2. **Customization**:  
   - Infrastructure can be tailored to meet highly specific business needs.  

### **Cloud-Based IaC**

# Task 8 : IaC - The Final Push

## Time to Fight

The technology required to send Sergeant Miles Creese back to 1984 is being held in a lab complex. All that's left now is to capture it and retrieve the tech. There's only one issue: it's located in a heavily fortified exterminator base, and the resistance doesn't have the resources to take them on. Lucky for the resistance, though, one piece of technology they do have their hands on is their 'Infrastructure at a Click' weapons system. This allows resistance fighters to deploy a weapon infrastructure (requiring a network and server components so the weapons can communicate with each other) to take on the machine army! After all, weapons can be reprovisioned; resistance fighters cannot! Simply define how many weapons you want using provision points and upgrade those weapons using configure points to defeat the incoming machines! Just don't let the machines take down your server, or it's game over!
