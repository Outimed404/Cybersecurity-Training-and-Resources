# Introduction to DevSecOps

DevSecOps is an evolution of the DevOps methodology that integrates security practices into the DevOps process. The primary goal of DevSecOps is to foster a culture of shared responsibility for security, enabling teams to develop secure applications more efficiently. By incorporating security at every stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), organizations can better manage risks and ensure that security is prioritized from the very beginning.

In this repository, you will find several key documents that provide further insights into DevSecOps, the software development lifecycle, and secure development methodologies:

- **[Introduction to DevSecOps](IntroductionToDevSecOps.md)**: This document provides a comprehensive overview of DevSecOps, its principles, and benefits.
  
- **[SDLC](SDLC.md)**: This file details the Software Development Lifecycle, outlining the various phases and the importance of security in each phase.

- **[SSDLC](SSDLC.md)**: This document focuses on the Secure Software Development Lifecycle, presenting methodologies and practices for integrating security into SDLC.

Feel free to explore each document to deepen your understanding of how DevSecOps can enhance security within your development processes!
