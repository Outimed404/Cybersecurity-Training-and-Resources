# Introduction to Container Security

Container security is a critical aspect of modern software development and deployment. Containers, such as Docker and Kubernetes, have revolutionized the way applications are developed, deployed, and scaled. However, with this new paradigm, new security challenges arise. Ensuring the security of containers throughout their lifecycle—from development to production—is essential for protecting your applications and data.

In this repository, you will find several key documents that provide a deeper understanding of container security, containerization, and the tools used to enhance container security:

- **[Container Hardening](ContainerHardening.md)**: This document discusses various strategies and best practices for hardening containers, ensuring that they are secure from potential threats.

- **[Container Vulnerabilities](ContainerVulnerabilities.md)**: This file explores common container vulnerabilities, how they can be exploited, and strategies for mitigating them.

- **[Introduction to Containerization](IntroToContainerisation.md)**: This document provides an overview of containerization, explaining what containers are, how they work, and why they are used in modern development workflows.

- **[Updated Introduction to Containerization](UpdateIntroToContainerisation.md)**: This updated version offers additional insights into the evolving landscape of containerization technologies and their impact on security.

- **[Introduction to Docker](IntroToDocker.md)**: This file introduces Docker, the most widely used containerization platform, and covers its architecture, features, and security considerations.

- **[Introduction to Kubernetes](IntroToKubernetes.md)**: This document provides an overview of Kubernetes, the container orchestration platform, and explains how it manages containerized applications at scale, along with associated security concerns.

Feel free to explore each document to deepen your understanding of containerization and how you can secure your containerized applications throughout their lifecycle.
