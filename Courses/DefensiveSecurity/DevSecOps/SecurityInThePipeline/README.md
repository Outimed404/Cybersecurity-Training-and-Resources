# Security in the Pipeline

The "Security in the Pipeline" module is a crucial segment of the DevSecOps curriculum, focusing on integrating security practices throughout the CI/CD pipeline. This module highlights key techniques to secure code, dependencies, and build processes, ensuring resilience and protection against vulnerabilities from development through deployment. By adopting these practices, development teams can embed security into their workflows and mitigate risks proactively.

## Overview of Course Modules

In this repository, you’ll find detailed write-ups for the essential components of pipeline security, each module providing step-by-step guidance and actionable insights:

### 1. **[Dependency Management](DependencyManagement.md)**
Managing dependencies is vital for any modern software project, as third-party libraries can introduce vulnerabilities into your codebase. This section covers:
- Best practices for dependency tracking and auditing.
- Automated tools for identifying outdated or vulnerable packages.
- Techniques for verifying the integrity and authenticity of dependencies.
- Strategies for establishing secure policies for third-party libraries.

### 2. **[Static Application Security Testing (SAST)](SAST.md)**
SAST is a critical method for detecting security vulnerabilities within your code before it runs. This module explains:
- How to integrate SAST tools into your CI/CD pipeline.
- Configuration tips for optimizing scan accuracy and minimizing false positives.
- Examples of common vulnerabilities caught by SAST, such as code injection and buffer overflows.
- Ways to leverage SAST reports to guide secure code reviews and remediations.

### 3. **[Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)](DAST.md)**
DAST provides a means to assess an application’s security by simulating real-world attack scenarios against a running instance. This section includes:
- Guidance on setting up DAST tools and integrating them with your pipeline.
- The differences between black-box and gray-box testing.
- Case studies demonstrating the identification of runtime vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Best practices for scheduling and automating DAST scans to align with deployment cycles.

### 4. **[Mother's Secret](MothersSecret.md)**
This module delves into more advanced concepts focusing on protecting sensitive information and secrets within your pipeline. Key topics include:
- An introduction to secrets management and why it is essential.
- Best practices for securely handling environment variables and API keys.

## Why Secure Your Pipeline?
A secure pipeline ensures that security practices are not an afterthought but an integral part of the development process. It helps:
- Detect vulnerabilities early, reducing the cost and effort of fixing issues.
- Build trust in the software supply chain by ensuring code integrity.
- Maintain compliance with security standards and best practices.
- Protect against data breaches and cyber-attacks that could exploit weaknesses in the build and deployment process.
